Inline formatting will provide your book with aesthetics and allow for a more enriched content.

^superscript^ includw two carets (^) surrounding the text, such as``ClO^-1^`` (ClO^-1^).


`Inline code` can be created by using a pair of backticks, for example,`` `code` ``


<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Small Caps</span> can be made by the HTML tag such as``<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Small Caps</span>`` (<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Small Caps</span>) 


Links are created using ``[text](link)``, for example ``[RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com)`` ([RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com))

Syntax for images is similar: just add an exclamation mark, for example ``![alt text or image title](path/to/image)`` 

Footnotes are put inside the square brackets after a caret`` ^[] ``, for example, ``^[These were taken from Bookdown.org]``^[These were taken from Bookdown.org]
