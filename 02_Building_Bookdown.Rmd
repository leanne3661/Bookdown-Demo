# Building Bookdown

##Creating a book is easy. {-}

```
Create a new project: 
    New Project 
    Empty Project 
    Directory Name 
    Choose your location 
    Hit Create Project 
    
New Markdown (First) file:
     New File
     R Markdown
     Give it a title and author  
     Hit OK
     
Save as index.Rmd
     Update the output bookdown::gitbook 
     Add site bookdown:bookdown_site
```
  
Every additional, new, Rmd file will become a new chapter. Each R Markdown file must start immediately with the chapter title using the first-level heading, e.g., # Chapter Title. Each chapter will then be saved and placed in order as completed, unless you tell it 
otherwise. Its best to save as 01_, 02_, 03_ etc. 

For bookdown to determine that the file is a new chapter the chapter title should start with the # each sub-level title will increase the number of #.

## Headers

As I just mentioned, section headers can be written after a number of pound signs.

```
# First-level header, such as Chapter Headers
## Second-level header
### Third-level header
```
It's important to note that, if you do not want a certain heading to be numbered, such as your index page, you can add {-} after the heading.
```
# Index {-}
```
